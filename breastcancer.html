  <h2><i>Symptoms</i></h2>
  <h2><i>The Test</i></h2>
  <p>
Forty percent of diagnosed breast cancers are detected by women who feel a lump,
so establishing a regular breast self-exam is very important.
 1) In the Shower<br>
Using the pads of your fingers, move around your entire breast in a circular<br>
pattern moving from the outside to the center, checking the entire breast and armpit<br>
area. Check both breasts each month feeling for any lump, thickening, or hardened<br>
knot. Notice any changes and get lumps evaluated by your healthcare provider.<br>
 2) In Front of a Mirror<br>
Visually inspect your breasts with your arms at your sides. Next, raise your arms high overhead.<br>
Look for any changes in the contour, any swelling, or dimpling of the skin, or changes<br>
in the nipples. Next, rest your palms on your hips and press firmly to flex your chest muscles.<br>
Left and right breasts will not exactly matchâ€”few women's breasts do, so look for any dimpling,<br>
puckering, or changes, particularly on one side.<br>
3) Lying Down<br>
When lying down, the breast tissue spreads out evenly along the chest wall. Place<br>
a pillow under your right shoulder and your right arm behind your head. Using your<br>
left hand, move the pads of your fingers around your right breast gently in small<br>
circular motions covering the entire breast area and armpit.<br>
Use light, medium, and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple; check for discharge and lumps.<br>
Repeat these steps for your left breast.<p>

      <h1><em><p style="color:#990033;font-size:40px;">ABOUT ME</p></h1></em>
  
             
<p><center> My name is Nasa Mbanugo. I was born in Walnut Creek on December 29. My family is from Nigeria,<br>
  we are Igbo. My full name is Chinasa Mbanugo, it is an Igbo name and in English it translates to <br>
  "God answers prayers". I have three siblings and they're all older than me! I have two <br>
  brothers and one sister. I play the piano, the guitar, and I sing classical music <br>
  (not as boring as you think, I promise!) I go to a prepatory school on the East Coast <br>
  called Phillips Exeter Academy. I run cross country, and track, but I also play ice hockey <br>
  (I'm a goalie, so you probably shouldn't mess with me). I am the co-founder of two clubs on campus:<br>
  WOKE an intersectional feminism club working to educate members of the community why the intersection <br>
  of race and gender is so important and WADE a West African dance group. My favorite food is ice cream, <br>
  because in my experience it can never, ever get old. </center></p>

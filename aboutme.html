      <h3><em><p style="color:#990033;font-size:40px;">ABOUT ME</p></h2></em>
  
             
<p> My name is Nasa. I was born in Walnut Creek on December 29. My family is from Nigeria, we are Igbo. My full name is Chinasa, it is an
  Igbo name and in English it translates to "God answers prayers". I have three siblings and they're all older than me! I have two
  brothers and one sister. I play the piano, the guitar, and I sing classical music (not as boring as you think, I promise!)
  I go to a prepatory school on the East Coast called Phillips Exeter Academy. I run cross country, and track, but I also play ice hockey
  (I'm a goalie, so you probably shouldn't mess with me). I am the co-founder of two clubs on campus: WOKE an intersectional feminism club 
  working to educate members of the community why the intersection of race and gender is so important and WADE a West African dance group.
  My favorite food is ice cream, because in my experience it can never, ever get old. </p>
